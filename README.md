# 3D-Reconstruction
3D Reconstruction from Single RGB Image

Indentification of objects from a single RGB input image and generating sepate masked images using YOLOv8 and YOLO-SAM architectures, generating 3-dimensional mesh for every masked image and concatenating them based on their x, y and relative z space co-ordinates to generate a 3D-reconstruction of the scene.
